# crashchrome
Crashes Chrome/Safari/almost any modern browser (or so it's supposed to).  Do not try on your computer if you don't want you computer to crash (or freeze the screen).  According to stevelacy "The code exploits the HTML5 pushState API used on all modern browsers to update the path of the site you are visiting during JavaScript page navigation.

Instead of just changing the path from ex. example.com/pageone to example.com/pagetwo it creates a string of numbers long enough to either slow the browser until it won't function, or crash."  I also have implemented a fallback that essentially opens up a CPU heavy tab every 0.1 seconds.

I (TeamIlluminati) take no responsibility for any damage done in any way by this webpage/application.
